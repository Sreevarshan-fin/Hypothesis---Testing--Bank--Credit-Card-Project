# Credit Card Campaign Optimization using A/B Testing

A practical experiment-driven approach using **behavioral transaction data and statistical validation** to design and evaluate a credit card campaign for young customers.

This project demonstrates how **data analysis, segmentation, and hypothesis testing** can support data-driven marketing decisions.

---

# Problem Statement

A growing bank wanted to expand its credit card business and increase market penetration.

However, launching a new credit card campaign without proper targeting could lead to:

* Low adoption rates
* Inefficient marketing spend
* Increased credit risk

The key challenge was identifying **the right customer segment** and validating whether a new campaign strategy could significantly improve customer engagement.

The goal was to use **data-driven experimentation** instead of assumptions to design and validate the campaign.

---

# Dataset

The analysis used three related datasets:

**Customers Dataset**

* 1,000 records
* Customer demographics and profile information

**Credit Score Dataset**

* 1,004 records
* Credit scores and credit limit details

**Transactions Dataset**

* 500,000 transaction records
* Transaction amount, category, payment method

These datasets allowed linking **customer demographics, credit behavior, and spending activity**.

---

# Solution Approach

The project followed **two main phases**.

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Initial analysis focused on understanding customer behavior.

Steps performed:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Handling missing values and outliers
* Behavioral spending analysis
* Customer segmentation by age group

Key insights:

* Customers aged **18–25 represent ~25% of the customer base**
* This segment shows **lower credit history and credit card adoption**
* However, they demonstrate **strong spending activity in categories like Electronics, Fashion, and Beauty**

This suggested a potential **untapped opportunity for targeted credit card campaigns**.

## 2. Experiment Design (A/B Testing)

 ### Campaign  architecture

To validate the campaign strategy, a controlled experiment was designed.

### Hypothesis

* **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**  - The new campaign has no impact on customer behavior.

* **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**  - The new campaign improves customer engagement and spending.

### Power Analysis

To ensure the experiment was statistically reliable:

* Significance level (α) = **0.05**
* Statistical power = **0.80**
* Target effect size = **0.4**

Based on these parameters:

**Sample Size ≈ 100 customers per group**

### Group Assignment

Customers were randomly assigned into:

* **Control Group**  -  Received the existing campaign

* **Test Group** - Received the new credit card campaign

Randomization ensured unbiased comparison between groups.

---

# Results

After running the experiment, the following metrics were observed:

| Metric             | Control Group | Test Group |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| Average Spend      | 221.18        | 235.98     |
| Standard Deviation | 21.36         | 36.66      |


Around 40 out of 100 customers actively began using the credit card after receiving the new campaign offer.

**Conversion Rate (Test Group):** ~40%

---

## Effect Size (Cohen’s d)

To measure the **practical magnitude of the campaign impact**, Cohen’s d was calculated.

### Difference in Means

```
235.98 − 221.18 = 14.80
```

### Pooled Standard Deviation

Formula:

```
SD_pooled = √((SD1² + SD2²) / 2)
```

Calculation:

```
SD_pooled = √((21.36² + 36.66²) / 2)
≈ 30
```

### Cohen’s d

```
d = (Mean_test − Mean_control) / SD_pooled
d = 14.8 / 30 ≈ 0.49
```

### Interpretation

```
Effect size ≈ 0.49 → Medium effect
```

This indicates the campaign produced a **moderate and practically meaningful increase in customer spending**.

### Experiment Validation

```
Planned effect size: 0.40
Observed effect size: 0.49
```

Since the observed effect is **higher than the planned detectable effect**, the experiment was **properly powered and the campaign impact is meaningful**.

# Experimental Testing

## a) Hypothesis Testing Using Critical Z-Value

### Z-Score Calculation

Formula:

```python
Z = (mean_test − mean_control) / √((sd_control²/n) + (sd_test²/n))
```

Python implementation:

```python
a = (control_std**2 / sample_size)
b = (test_std**2 / sample_size)

z_score = (test_mean - control_mean) / np.sqrt(a + b)
z_score
```

Result:

```
Z_score = 2.7466
```

### Critical Z-Value (Right-Tailed Test)

For significance level **α = 0.05**

```python
critical_z = st.norm.ppf(1 - alpha)
critical_z
```

Result:

```
Critical_Z ≈ 1.645
```

### Decision Rule

```
If Z_score > Critical_Z → Reject H₀
```

```
2.7466 > 1.645
```

✅ **Result:** Reject the null hypothesis.
The campaign produced a **statistically significant uplift**.

---

# b) Hypothesis Testing Using P-Value

### P-Value Calculation

For a right-tailed test:

```python
p_value = 1 - st.norm.cdf(z_score)
p_value
```

Result:

```
p_value ≈ 0.0030
```

### Decision Rule

```
If p_value < α (0.05) → Reject H₀
```

```
0.003 < 0.05
```

✅ **Result:** Reject the null hypothesis.

The campaign effect is **statistically significant**.

---

# Conclusion

Both methods confirm the same result:

* **Z-Test:** Z_score > Critical_Z
* **P-Value:** p_value < 0.05

Therefore, the **new campaign significantly increased customer spending** compared to the control group.

---

# Business Impact

The experiment demonstrates how **data-driven experimentation can guide marketing strategy**.

Key outcomes:

* Increased credit card activation and usage
* Better targeting of high-potential customer segments
* Reduced marketing risk through statistical validation
* Evidence-based campaign design

Based on the results, the campaign strategy can be **scaled for the 18–25 customer segment** with further optimization.
